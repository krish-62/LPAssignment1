Q1. What is a bash shell script? Give one example. 

-> A Bash shell script is a text file that contains a set of commands written for the Bash interpreter to execute automatically. Instead of typing each command manually, it is also used to automate tasks by running the script.
EX:
┌──(itachi-62㉿itachi-62)-[~]
└─$ chmod +x demo.sh

┌──(itachi-62㉿itachi-62)-[~]
└─$ ./demo.sh
This is my first Bash script!

Q2. Write a simple shell script to print “Hello World”. 

-> ┌──(itachi-62㉿itachi-62)-[~]
└─$ echo "Hello World!" >> hello.sh

┌──(itachi-62㉿itachi-62)-[~]
└─$ chmod +x hello.sh                                                                                                                                                                          
./hello.sh
Hello World

Q3. What is the purpose of comments (#) in a shell script? 

-> When you want to add comments to your script you use #. when you use # the text that is written in that line is ignored by the shell 
EX:

#!/bin/bash
# This script prints a greeting
echo "Hello World"  # This prints text to the screen

Q4. How do you declare variables (int, float, double, string, Boolean, and char
in a shell script?

-> Actually in bash everything is a string by default unlike C, Python or any other language they use datatypes but in bash everything is string by default.

int- Used with $(( )) for math → sum=$((num + 5)).
float/double- Bash doesn’t support float math natively. Use bc or awk: `echo "$num + 1.2".
string- Access with $name.
boolean- Evaluate with if [ "$flag" = true ].
char- Treated as a one-character string.

Q5. Write a shell script to display the current date and time of the system.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Current date and time: $(date)"

output: 
Current date and time: Tue Oct 7 12:42:10 IST 2025

Q6. Explain the difference between a constant and a variable in bash script.

-> A variable is a name under which a value can be stored, and can be used during the executrion of the script.
Ex: 
count=5
count=$((count + 1))
echo $count   

Output: 6

-> A constant is a variable whose value will never change.
readonly PI=3.14159
echo $PI
PI=5   

Error: bash: PI: readonly variable

Q7. Write a shell script to read two integer number from the user and compute the
sum of both the number. 

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter first number: "
read num1
echo "Enter second number: "
read num2
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "The sum is: $sum"

Q8. What is the use of source command in shell scripting?

-> The source command executes a script in the current shell instead of spawning a new one.
-> It is useful for loading environment variables or functions into your current shell session.
Ex:
source config.sh

Q9. How can you debug a shell script? Give two methods.

Method 1: Add -x when running the script:

bash -x script.sh

It prints each command before executing it, useful for tracing.

Method 2: Add set -x and set +x inside the script:

#!/bin/bash
set -x  # Start debugging
echo "Running script..."
set +x  # Stop debugging
echo "Done."

Q10. Write a bash script to create and delete a file.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a filename to create:"
read filename
touch "$filename"
echo "File '$filename' created successfully."
echo "Do you want to delete it? (y/n)"
read ans
if [ "$ans" = "y" ]; then
    rm "$filename"
    echo "File '$filename' deleted."
else
    echo "File not deleted."
