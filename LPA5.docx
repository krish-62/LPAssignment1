Q3.Write a command to list all hidden files in the current directory.

->ls -a is the command that is used to list all the hidden files in the current directory. The -a option shows all the files including hidden ones.

Q4.Explain the difference between hard links and soft links (symbolic links) in Linux.

Hard Link:
-> Points directly to the file's data on the disk.
-> File can be accessed even if the original file is deleted.
-> But it cannot link directories across filesystems.

Soft Link:
-> It points to the path of the original file.
-> If the original file is deleted, the symlink becomes broken.
-> It can link across filesystems and directories.

Q5.A file has permissions -rwxr-x--x. Explain who can read, write, and execute it.

-> The first part (rwx) are the permissions that the owner or the user has on a file. Here the owner can read,write and execute the file.
-> The Second part (r-X) are the permissions that a group has ona file. Here a group can read and execute, but cannot write.
-> The third part (--x) are the permissions that others have and here the others can only execute the file.

Q6.Write the command to change the group ownership of a file testfile.txt to group group2.

->chgrp staff testfile.txt

Q7. Why is it dangerous to give 777 permissions to a file? Explain with an example.

-> If you give 777 permissions to a file everyone can read,write,and execute the file.

Q8.What is the difference between apropos (i.e., man -k) and whatis (i.e., man -f)?

-> apropos (i.e., man -k) command is used to search the man pages for a keyword across descriptions.
-> Ex: apropos copy--this command shows all the commnds related to "copy".
OUTPUT:

┌──(itachi-62㉿itachi-62)-[~]
└─$ apropos copy                                                                                                                                                                               
Clone (3pm)          - recursively copy Perl datatypes
bcopy (3)            - copy byte sequence
COPY (7)             - copy data between a file and a table
copy_file_range (2)  - Copy a range of data from one file to another
copysign (3)         - copy sign of a number
copysignf (3)        - copy sign of a number
copysignl (3)        - copy sign of a number
cp (1)               - copy files and directories
cpio (1)             - copy files to and from archives
dd (1)               - convert and copy a file
debconf-copydb (1)   - copy a debconf database
getunwind (2)        - copy the unwind data to caller's buffer
getutmp (3)          - copy utmp structure to utmpx, and vice versa
getutmpx (3)         - copy utmp structure to utmpx, and vice versa
git-checkout-index (1) - Copy files from the index to the working tree
i686-w64-mingw32-objcopy (1) - copy and translate object files
install (1)          - copy files and set attributes

-> whatis (i.e., man -f) command is used to diaplay a one line description of a specific command.
-> Ex: whatis cp -- this command shows only the descrion of cp.
OUTPUT:

└─$ whatis cp                                                                                                                                                                                  
cp (1)               - copy files and directories

Q9.Write a command to redirect the error output of a command to a file named
error.log.

-> command 2> error.log - here 2> redirects file descriptor to a file.

Q10.How can you use the tee command to append output to a file instead of
overwriting it?

-> command | tee -a filename- here -a option makes tee append to the file instead of overwriting it.
